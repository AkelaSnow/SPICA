# SPICA
Experimental H3D tool for serializing/deserializing BCH.

Dependencies:
- OpenTK
- OpenTK.GLControl

Both can be found on NuGet.

Note: The version of OpenTK.GLControl on NuGet is broken, so it's recommended to build it yourself from source and manually add a reference to the compiled library.
